# Botocracy

Democracy has failed, countries are starting to use A.I. instead of a government. Survive as long as you can as the leader of your country, before it, or you, collapse under pressure!

"Botocracy" is a resource management game, where you play as an A.I. that was made to rule countries. The game emphasizes the gap between an A.I.'s needs and those of the country, and the tension between numerical goals and the intricate considerations of ruling a country.
The project examines the connection of various game systems in order to form game mechanics that support the narrative.

Developed as my final project at Bezalel Academy of Art and Design.  
Guidance: Gideon Rimmer.

## Installation
Supported platforms:
* Windows
* macOS

Instructions:
1. Get the game from [itch.io](https://orkachlon.itch.io/botocracy)
2. Extract zip and play (it's recommended to start with the tutorial).

## Implementation
The game was made in Unity. Art was partly designed by me and some by StableDiffusion models. Sound and music found online.  

* Designed game mechanics from scratch by prototyping and playtesting.
* Implemented a custom event system to control game flow.
* Modified and extended a basic hex board system to fit the game. Implemented hex grid algorithms.
* Used object pooling to improve performance.
* Implemented various data retrieval methods to get game content from files.
* Wrote shaders for in game effects.
* Designed the entire UI and menus.
* Used DOTween for smooth async parmeterized animations.
